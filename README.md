# Connect Four

Connect Four is a two player game in which players take turns in dropping a colored disc into a seven-column six-row grid. The first player who forms a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of four of one's discs wins.

I created a web-based version of the physical game as part of the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at Spiced Academy in July 2019. Stylistically, I tried to stay true as much as possible to the original game.

## The Stack:

- HTML, CSS, Javascript/jQuery
